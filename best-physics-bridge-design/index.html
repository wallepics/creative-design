<p>A beam bridge can take great weight over a short distance truss bridges take advantage of the strength of the shape of a triangle while suspension bridges can handle torque and tension across a long distance. Design and build a bridge to hold 15 kg up to a maximum of 22 kg 44 lbs using only popsicle sticks 4. Truss bridges use triangles in their design to efficiently transfer their loads. Students become classroom engineers. Therefore it became very popular and was considered one of the best designs for railroad bridges back in the day.</p>
