<p><strong>Ackerman Steering Design Calculations</strong>, Ackerman steering is normally computed using a Jeantaud diagram Charles Jeantaud in 1878 created a geometrical method to arrive at Ackerman steering where the equal length steerings arms are placed on a line connecting the wheel center and the center of the rear axle. No single intersection point will result in true Ackerman steering over the whole range but by moving the intersect point in the longitudinal plane. Supported with help of calculations referral values and diagrams which were actually applied in professional go kart. Steering Geometry The Ackerman steering geometry is selected for the vehicle because this geometry enables the vehicle to turn about the common centre ie.</p>

<p>Since we know the wheelbase B and just found the angle the right wheel is at we can find the distance x. In order to have a single theoretical rotation centre there are equations that relate the front wheels X the karts pitch Y and the two angles alpha and beta of the two front wheels with the axis that joins the stub axles. Design of Ackerman steering geometry By putting all these values we got R 3119m Steering Ratio. The compressor generates the compressed air for the whole system.</p>

<p>Although Ackerman can be achieved by having different steer arm lengths on each side I do not think this is optimum for cars running longer tracks. Point Bs X coordinate RAA cosAA SAL Point Bs Y coordinate RAA sin AA SAL Where RAA is the Ackerman Arm Radius AA is the Ackerman Angle SAL is the steering angle of the left wheel. If you are going to use it high percentage Ackerman is required because Ackerman is slow to build eg 100 Ackerman 4 degrees of steer angle at the steering axis gives approx 1 degree or 6mm toe out overall.
