<p>The concept of engineering has existed since ancient times as humans devised fundamental inventions such as the pulley lever and wheel. Applying scientific and mathematical principles to practical ends such as the design manufacture and operation of efficient and economical structures machines processes and systems. Though the structures that they built like roads and bridges took some inspiration from the Greek civilization the Romans enduring success with building continues to influence modern-day engineers and their civil projects. However due to incomplete documentation and loss of finished objects most of the original machines cannot be verified and many of the inventions did not pass down to later generations.</p>
