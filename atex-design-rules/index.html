<p><strong>Atex Design Rules</strong>, The ATEX directives are two EU directives describing the minimum safety requirements for workplaces and equipment used in explosive atmospheres. ATEX and IEC Design Competence Requirements The requirements for personnel involved in the process of designing plant or equipment for use in potentially explosive atmospheres including equipment that may be located in the safe area but have functionality involved in the safe explosion prevention or mitigation should be given serious consideration. Within Europe when electronic or electrical equipment of any kind is intended for use in a potentially hazardous area the equipment must be ATEX-certified per the EU directive 201434 which is more commonly known as the ATEX 114 directive. If you manufacture any products matching the definitions the ATEX Regulations apply to you.</p>
