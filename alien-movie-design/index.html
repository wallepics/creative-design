<p><strong>Alien Movie Design</strong>, After a space merchant vessel receives an unknown transmission as a distress call one of the crew is attacked by a mysterious life form and they soon realize that its life cycle has merely begun. Sci-fi movies have used alien creature designs to push some of their boldest visions whether the aliens in question come in peace or otherwise. Thirty-eight years later the design of the xenomorph creature from Alien set a new standard for how science fiction films depict extraterrestrials. Now it so happens that you cant do a film like Alien which does involve effects without making sure that they are going to be up to the standard set by Star Wars Close Encounters and the Big Daddy of them all 2001.</p>

<p>After studying Alien in intimate detail its time to look at the typography and design of Ridley Scotts other classic sci-fi movie Blade Runner. Then Ridley Scott was doing this movie called Alien that was going to be a B-movie for Fox he didnt know how big it would be. I felt that Alien should be primarily a film with a story about seven real characters and that this would be the strength of the film not the effects. Thirty-eight years later the design of the xenomorph creature from Alien set a new standard for how science fiction films depict extraterrestrials. For the most part the movies costume design displays a timeless aesthetic for a working interstellar haulage crew.</p>
