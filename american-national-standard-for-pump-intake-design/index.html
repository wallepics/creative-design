<p>Lindsey Hunt on Pump Intake Design ANSI HI 98. Typical design objectives are to ensure that a pump station is designed according to best practice and conforms to the requirements set out in the American National Standard for Pump Intake Design 1998. Oversized wet wells in wastewater pumping stations lead to the accumulation of grit sludge and floatable materials. Trench-type wet wells in compliance with ANSIHI 98 the American National Standard for Pump Intake Design minimize wet well volume and facilitate wet well cleaning through periodic pump down operations. Those guidelines present design and operational recommendations on model pump intakes and the best flow conditions before a pumps inlet in order to guarantee best pump performance.</p>
