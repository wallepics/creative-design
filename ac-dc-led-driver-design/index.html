<p>AC Input or Off-Line LED drivers take line voltage either low line 100-120VAC or high line 200-240VAC. In this paper a single-stage isolated high-power factor ac-dc LED driver is proposed and analyzed in detail which is composed of a buck-boost power factor correction unit operating in. LED Lighting Design Guide Safety and Reliability of LED Bulbs An LED lamp contains power conversion electronics ACDC driver IC for the LEDs a heat sink for thermal management and optics to optimize light quality. Since LED bulbs are intended to be form factor-compatible with current incandescent and CFL bulbs they will have an ACDC power.
