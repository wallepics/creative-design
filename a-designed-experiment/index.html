<p>Well-designed experiments can produce significantly more information and often require fewer runs than haphazard or unplanned experiments. In industry designed experiments can be used to systematically investigate the process or product variables that affect product quality. A designed experiment is a series of runs or tests in which you purposefully make changes to input variables at the same time and observe the responses.
