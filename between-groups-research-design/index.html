<p><strong>Between Groups Research Design</strong>, Within -subjects or repeated-measures study design. Community the suitable research design is called Descriptive. A between group design is normally an experiment that has two or more groups as subjects where each subject is usually tested by a different testing factor in an alternating process. If the researchers want to be a little more accurate and reduce the chances of differences between the groups having an effect they use modifications of the design.</p>

<p>The simplest of all experimental designs is the two-group posttest-only randomized experiment. Community the suitable research design is called Descriptive. Between-subjects is a type of experimental design in which the subjects of an experiment are assigned to different conditions with each subject experiencing only one of the experimental conditions. One common experimental design method is a between-subjects design which is when two or more separate groups are compared.</p>
