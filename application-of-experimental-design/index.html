<p>An experimentalist changes one or several process variables factors in order to observe the effect the changes have on one or several response variables. Epub 2013 Nov 28. A design that chooses experimental points uniformly scattered on the domain is known as uniform experimental design and uniform experimental design can be regarded as a fractional factorial design with model uncertainty a space-filling design for computer experiments a robust design against the model specification and a supersaturated design and can be applied to experiments with mixtures. This review discusses the rigorous experimental design and sample preparation in the context of applying metagenomics in environmental sciences and biotechnology. The application of Design of Experiments DoE in the pharmaceutical industry is becoming a mandatory tool in recent times.</p>
