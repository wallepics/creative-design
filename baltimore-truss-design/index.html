<p><strong>Baltimore Truss Design</strong>, The Baltimore truss is a sub-type of the Pratt truss but differs by the addition of half-length struts or ties in the top bottom or both parts of the panels. In the Howe truss design the longer diagonal members are in compression while the shorter vertical members are in tension. Two of the most used truss bridges are of the Pratt and Howe design. A Baltimore truss has additional bracing in the lower section of the truss to prevent buckling in the compression members and to control deflection.</p>

<p>The K truss bridge design was a variation on another Pratt truss style called the Parker truss. Originally designed by Thomas and Caleb Pratt in 1844 the Pratt truss successfully made the transition from wood designs to metal. Introduction Through our experiment it was found that the bridge design that minimized the maximum compression force was the Howe Bridge.

<p>The Baltimore truss is a subclass of the Pratt truss. A truss can be easily and accurately modeled in two dimensions but three-dimensional analysis is helpful when several similar trusses resist more than just vertical gravity loads - a common situation in open frame pavilions or where a truss serves to drag a lateral force between two shear wall segments. You will also use math and technology to estimate the tensions-compressions on the truss elements as well as the maximum strength of this bridge based on.
