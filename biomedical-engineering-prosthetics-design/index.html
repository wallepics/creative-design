<p>A mechanical foot sliced off cleanly at the ankle sits on a shelfa prosthesis for testing. One type of biomedical engineering is the field of prostheses or artificial body parts. Many engineers might also get certified to work as prosthetists the people who design build tune and fit prosthetics to patients in a hospital setting. Because a prosthetic leg is not one size fits all this involves using a combination of existing components and parts and custom-fabricated pieces such as the sockets that connect a prosthetic device with a persons.</p>

<p>This course has five design projects the highlight of which is dubbed the roller coaster experiment. Like those working in other engineering disciplines they use their knowledge of science and math but they combine this with a background in medicine. Your duties include coming up with new designs improving existing devices sketching them in design software and working with product designers and manufacturers to address production issues. Ultimately I believe you are the only one who can truly answer it. Answer 1 of 7.</p>
