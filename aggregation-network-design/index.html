<p><strong>Aggregation Network Design</strong>, This is driving DWDM ever deeper into access networks and. Bandwidth Aggregation-allows multiple switch port links to be combined so as to achieve higher throughput between switches called EtherChannel from Cisco. The aggregation network can use the following technologies for forwarding data. In small networks uplink speeds of about 1Gbps might even become satisfactory depending on the total number of user devices which would be served by each wiring closet and the application demands on the network.</p>

<p>The choice of an appropriate architectural approach and sizing model for the aggregation network is studied in this paper through cost optimization models which encompass as-pects of non-stop delivery service ﬂexibility policy management and cost allocation. Aggregation of Customers Customers are one of the most commonly aggregated elements in network design models. In order to cope with future demand organisations require high quality high performance networks that securely deliver data and applications to a diverse range of devices from a wide variety of locations. While in a three-tier network one server may need to traverse a hierarchical path through two aggregation switches and one core switch to communicate with another switch which adds latency and creates traffic bottlenecks.</p>

<p>Access and Aggregation networks are facing relentless pressure to cost effectively expand capacity to meet the ever-rising bandwidth demands from end users. In small networks uplink speeds of about 1Gbps might even become satisfactory depending on the total number of user devices which would be served by each wiring closet and the application demands on the network. While in a three-tier network one server may need to traverse a hierarchical path through two aggregation switches and one core switch to communicate with another switch which adds latency and creates traffic bottlenecks.
