<p><strong>Anser Putter Design</strong>, From what Ive read it seems it may be best to go with an old school milled putterLike a lot searches it started from looking at the Scotty 009 which led me to the Byron DH89. Many of todays putters are still based on the original Ping Anser designed originally by Karsten Solheim a Norwegian-born engineer who worked on jet fighters and missile guidance systems after World War II. Over the last forty years this iconic design has notched up more than 500 wins on the major professional tours and theyre still coming. The Anser putter began a long and proud history of truly innovative equipment design throughout Pings entire product line ultimately resulting in over 400 patents that has set Ping at the top of the list of golf design and manufacturing companies.</p>
