<p>Keep track of how long the rocket car travels and how far it goes. The air car is a clean easy to drive light weight and high performance car. When the end of the straw is aimed backward the air pushes your car forward as described by Newtons third law of motion. It eliminates the use of non-renewable fuels and Thereby preventing pollution and step to a healthier environment. The car can be filled with compressed air in less than five minutes with a commercial-grade air compressor which are found at just about any gas station at a cost of less than 2 per fill-up.</p>
