<p>Typically hand calculations may facilitate this design process which considerably narrows the design space and provides a good starting point for the designer. EeNews Europe asked about the move and plans for the company. Conventional analog IC design is particularly time-consuming due to the complicated non-linear relationship between the design parameters and devicecircuitsystem specifications. Ron Black formerly CEO with Rambus and Imagination Technologies has taken up the position of CEO of RISC-V core IP licensor Codasip GmbH. The signals described above fall within the category of analog signals though RF and microwave signals are significantly higher than most standard analog signals used in traditional PCB designs.</p>
