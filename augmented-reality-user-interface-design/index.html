Using the devices camera to present the physical world onscreen live your app superimposes three-dimensional virtual objects creating the illusion that these objects actually exist. Augmented reality or AR lets you deliver immersive engaging experiences that seamlessly blend virtual objects with the real world. We present the concepts and the user interface UI designs for two Augmented Reality AR applications which help to tackle these issues. Maintenance departments of producing companies in most industrial countries are facing challenges originating from an aging workforce increasing product variety and the pressure to increase productivity.</p>
