<p>When heavy objects travel over a bridge the weight attempts to modify the structure through the creation of a bending. The curved design of the arch bridge gives the structure an added element of strength that is not always found in alternative designs. They come with economic construction as they use materials efficiently. This means that in certain restricted spaces the truss bridge may not be the best option.</p>

<p>Pratt Truss Bridge design is a cost-effective structure that is easier to build by unskilled labor it has a low initial cost and is easy to transport. This means that in certain restricted spaces the truss bridge may not be the best option. Compared to other bridge designs truss bridge designs often require fewer materials to complete the structure. List of the Advantages of Arch Bridges. The truss bridge uses a LOT of parts.</p>

<p>It offers higher levels of resistance compared to other designs. Two of the most used truss bridges are of the Pratt and Howe design. The basic concept of designing a bridge in the K-truss structure is that it is comprised of shorter members and due to the presence of shorter members it can resist buckling from compression to a great extent.

<p>This process makes it easier to prevent ongoing traffic delays during maintenance efforts while also giving the bridge extra strength because it can transfer the pressure weight and. This makes it possible to save on design and implementation costs while also reducing the labor needs of the structure. The Pros of Truss Bridges.
