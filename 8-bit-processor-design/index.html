<p>I modified the architecture of the SAP-1 found in Digital Computer Electronics for my 8-bit computer. Variables in DATA from the drop-down list for the compiler memory modelMake sure Allow reentrant functions is not selected. While still in the C Compiler options click on Code. In this implementation I will show you how to design a simple 8-bit single-cycle processor which includes an ALU a register file and control logic using Verilog HDL.
