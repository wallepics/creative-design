<p><strong>Temporary Roof Design</strong>, This means the use of a private garden terrace. Small enough to fit correctly and large enough for the private pleasure. Regardless of which code is used snow loading has always presented a potential problem for scaffold designers in temporary roof scaffold design especially for larger span temporary roofs.

<p>This is why a proper site survey is required to asses the location site orientation nearby buildings and to observe if there is any possibility of wind funneling in order to be able to produce a realistic scaffold model using structural. The disadvantage of this is the double penthouse home it is only equipped with a rooftop terrace with no spaces. It may stand on the ground or on top of a building or be an extension of a scaffold around a building. As previously mentioned in part 1 of this article tension barscables or pick-up braces are often specified on the scaffold design drawings to increase the snow load bearing capacity of a temporary roof.</p>
