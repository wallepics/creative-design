<p>Biomimicry is great example of good design. The skin of a shark is an evolutionary trait that increases its speed and prevents microorganisms from latching onto the skin. The bio-enhancing admix and three dimensional designs of ECOncretes products induce a layer of biogenic buildup that makes the concrete stronger and more durable through bioprotection which is perfect for creating structures like seawalls breakwaters bridge foundations and urban waterfronts. Using carpet tiles in a random non-directional pattern mimics a forest floor and instead of having to replace the entire floor the individual tiles can be replaced resulting in lower maintenance costs and less waste.</p>
