<p>The air preheater is to recover the heat from the boiler flue gas which increases the thermal efficiency of the boiler by reducing the useful heat lost in the flue gas. Air pre-heater is a heat transfer surface in which air temperature is raised by transferring heat from other media such as flue gas Hot air is necessary for rapid combustion in the furnace and also for drying coal in milling plants. Mechanical collectors ESPs manways ID fans. Typically flue gases leave. Rama Bhupal Reddy Abstract.</p>
