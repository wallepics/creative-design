<p>Science has proven the relationship between physical activity happiness and overall health. The firm is employee-owned and architects at all levels take an active role in the day-to-day running of the firm. Active Design in Buildings investigates how architecture influences our behavior. Passive solar design doesnt use any outside energy or require much special equipment but simply takes advantage of existing natural phenomena like the direction of the sun or the insulating properties of concrete.</p>

<p>This is as opposed to active design which makes use of active building services systems to create comfortable conditions such as boilers and chillers mechanical ventilation electric lighting and so on. The phrase emerged out the Active Design Guidelines which was a manual originally published by the City of New York in 2010 to guide the creation of health-promoting buildings streets and urban spaces based on the latest academic research and best practices in the field. Active Design in Buildings. An active building sometimes referred to as an energy positive building is one that generates and stores its own electricity. Drawing energy from solar power batteries store and release energy to make buildings entirely self-sufficient.</p>

This is seen as a contrast to the Passivhaus approach which stresses the significance of heating and cooling.
