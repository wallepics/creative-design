<p>API 620 Tanks are generally utilized for Liquefied Natural Gas LNG storage as well as other chemicals which require internal design pressures in excess of those allowed by API 650. The API 620 tank standard regulates the design and construction of large chemical and oil storage tanks at least 300 feet in diameter that can house contents up to 15 PSI such as liquefied natural gas LNG cryogenic liquids and other low-temperature -325 to 250 degrees F higher-pressure liquids gases and vapors. On an API 620 project determination of the thicknesses of the shell roof and floor plates are quick in comparison with the design details required for the aforementioned items. Atmospheric pressure no refrigerated tanks shall be designed to API 650.</p>
