<p>A retrospective cohort study allows the investigator to describe a population over time or obtain preliminary measures of association to develop future studies and interventions. The cohort design is a prospective or less commonly retrospective observational design in which the groups cohorts are determined by the level of the explanatory variable. A retrospective cohort study also called a historic cohort study is a longitudinal cohort study that studies a cohort of individuals that share a common exposure. A prospective cohort study design is ranked higher in the hierarchy of evidence than a retrospective design because the outcome predictor and confounding variables can be better measured and controlled.</p>
