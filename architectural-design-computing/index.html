<p>The Design Computing research cluster investigates computation as a subject of critical and creative inquiry in architecture. IEEE defines architectural design as the process of defining a collection of hardware and software components and their interfaces to establish the framework for the development of a computer system This framework is established by examining the software requirements document and designing a model for providing implementation details. Introduction 3 What is Computer Architecture. This computer-aided design software is mainly used for industrial design and for architecture.</p>

<p>IJAC is committed to deepening the understanding of the foundations of digital systems for architectural design. We focus on the development of innovative computational tools processes and. It involves developing computational procedures and models for the formulation of design requirements and rules algorithmic generation of designs analysis simulation and evaluation of building performance for design optimization of buildings. As such the computer architecture governs the design of a family of computers and defines the logical interface that is targeted by programming languages and their compilers.
