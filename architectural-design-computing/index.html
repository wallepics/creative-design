<p>IJAC is committed to deepening the understanding of the foundations of digital systems for architectural design. We focus on the development of innovative computational tools processes and. It involves developing computational procedures and models for the formulation of design requirements and rules algorithmic generation of designs analysis simulation and evaluation of building performance for design optimization of buildings. As such the computer architecture governs the design of a family of computers and defines the logical interface that is targeted by programming languages and their compilers.
