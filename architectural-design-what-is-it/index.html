<p>Architectural design is the process an architect goes through in his or her work in doing the preparatory work for the construction of a building. Typical outputs are principles structural specifications processes models and standards. They work with space and elements to create a coherent and functional structure. Principles - a set of guiding ideas that form the basis of the architecture. Architectural designers include people who studied architecture and people who trained in other fields of design.</p>
