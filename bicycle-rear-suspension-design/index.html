<p><strong>Bicycle Rear Suspension Design</strong>, Even the holy grail of dual-suspension has been attempted with the goal of suspending the rear wheel without altering the action of pedaling. The most obvious difference with this design is that the bottom bracket and therefore the entire drivetrain is positioned on a link between the front and rear triangles. A magnetorheological MR damper is used to design a rear suspension system that can balance the need of ride comfort through shock absorption and performance characteristics such as handling and pedaling efficiency by using active control. Development of a rear suspension system that has been designed for a mountain bike.</p>
