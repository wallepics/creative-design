<p>Computer-aided Design CAD software enables the design of patient-specific cranial implants but it often requires of a lot of manual user-interactions. CAD or computer-aided design and drafting CADD is technology for design and technical documentation which replaces manual drafting with an automated process. Nat Catal 3 574584 2020. CAD programs eliminate the tedious manual drafting process replacing it with an automated process in which designers can change their drawings or designs and immediately view or print the modified results.
