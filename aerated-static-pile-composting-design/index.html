<p><strong>Aerated Static Pile Composting Design</strong>, Currently within the UK windrow composting is the dominant technology. Aerated static pile composting is a form of thermophilic composting accelerated and managed through the pushing positive pressure or pulling negative pressure of air through the composting pile. The key design criteria of a forced aeration system include the rate of airflow cfmcy of compost the uniformity of airflow through the whole pile and the ability to intelligently adjust the airflow to control temperatures early in the process. Aerated Static Pile or ASP systems have been the standard for providing aeration to active compost piles for over 40 years.</p>
