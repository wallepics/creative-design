<p>The relative efficiency of factorials continues to increase with every added factor. Wider inductive basis ie it covers a broader area or volume of X-space from which to draw inferences about your process. The Advantages and Challenges of Using Factorial Designs One of the big advantages of factorial designs is that they allow researchers to look for interactions between independent variables. A completely randomized design that you proposed runs the risk of an unbalanced design and confounding factors making it difficult to determine the effect of the individual factors.</p>

<p>A completely randomized design that you proposed runs the risk of an unbalanced design and confounding factors making it difficult to determine the effect of the individual factors. The relative efficiency of factorials continues to increase with every added factor. Adding 3 center points is very important for 2 reasons. For example a 2-level full factorial design with 6 factors requires 64 runs. The drawback of a fractionated design is that some interactions may be confounded with other effects.</p>

By using a factorial design the business researcher can analyze both variables at the same time in one design saving the time and effort of doing two different analyses and minimizing the experiment-wise error rate. This exhaustive approach makes it impossible for any interactions to be missed as all factor interactions are accounted for. Factorial Design An Overview Sciencedirect Topics.</p>
