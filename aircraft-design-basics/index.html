There are four basic areas that aeronautical engineers must understand in order to be able to design planes. Aircraft Propeller Design The basic engineering behind how propeller blades work hasnt changed a great deal over the years however there have been a number of significant modifications in the materials used to build propellers and modifications to their use consistent with gains in engine power and technology which has led to greater efficiency.
