<p>In the central part of the flowchart is located the bridge design process where the input data regulations and results are interacting together. The magnitude of the East Bridge a 3 span suspension bridge of span lengths 535 1624 and 535 m has warranted an aerodynamic design process which involves. The weight torsional stiffness and especially the shape of the cross section of a suspension bridge deck determine the stability of the bridge in strong winds. Steel works great for earthquake resistant designs but from an aerodynamic point of view the bridge towers become very light and flexible.

<p>Without mitigating measures the tower legs would literally start to swing from side to side in strong winds causing aerodynamic instability or bounce. Fluid mechanics is a fascinating and important branch of science and engineering and the Aerospace Sciences Division has diverse research interests in phenomena relevant to fixed and rotary wing aircraft. This textbook is intended for studies in structural dynamics or wind engineering with special focus on the stochastic theory of wind induced dynamic response calculations for slender bridges or other line- like civil engineering type of structures.
