<p>An ASIC is basically an integrated circuit designed specifically for a special purpose or application. Generally an ASIC design will be undertaken for a product that will have a large production run and the ASIC may contain a very large part of the electronics needed on a single integrated circuit. An Application-Specific Integrated Circuit ASIC is a device whose function is determined by design engineers to satisfy the requirements of a particular application. Asicapplication specific integrated circuit Design Flow ASICApplication specific integrated circuit is designed for a special solo purpose and the function of chip is same through out the chip lifeIts digital circuitry is made up of permanently connected gates and flip flops in silicon so the logic function cant be changed.</p>

An application-specific integrated circuit is an integrated circuit chip customized for a particular use rather than intended for general-purpose use.

<p>Generally an ASIC design will be undertaken for a product that will have a large production run and the ASIC may contain a very large part of the electronics needed on a single integrated circuit. Strictly speaking this also implies that an ASIC is built only for one and only one customer. ASICs are silicon chips designed for a very specific purpose created to perform a repeated function very effectively as opposed to.
