<p>2 An oil tanker. Frame- It is a steel plate that runs longitudinally or transversely throughout the hull structure. The cruise ship hull is designed by the shipyard while the interiors and all the special features are designed by architects. Stations from middle to forward are drawn on the right side. The actual cruise shipbuilding takes 2 to 3 years the design plans are usually started a year ahead.</p>
